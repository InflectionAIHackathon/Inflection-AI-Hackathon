## ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious Data Patterns

### üîç Extreme Year-over-Year Changes

- **Trans-Nzoia 2017-2018:** +53.7% change
  - _Requires verification - unusually high increase_
- **Nakuru 2015-2016:** +80.8% change
  - _Suspicious jump - needs validation_

### üìä Data Quality Red Flags

1. **Systematic Coverage Decline:** 2022-2023 show systematic data collection problems
2. **Missing Major Counties:** Kakamega (historically high producer) has no data
3. **Incomplete Recent Years:** 2023 only 47% coverage
4. **Inconsistent Reporting:** Some counties missing recent years while others have complete data

---

## üîç Cross-Checking with Known Patterns

### ‚úÖ Validated Patterns

- **Major Counties:** Trans-Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru show realistic production ranges
- **Geographic Distribution:** Rift Valley counties dominate production (as expected)
- **Production Volumes:** Total national production within expected ranges

### ‚ùå Inconsistencies Identified

- **Missing Western Kenya:** Kakamega, Kisii under-represented in recent years
- **Coverage Gaps:** Recent years show systematic data collection issues
- **Data Completeness:** 2022-2023 data insufficient for reliable analysis

---

## üìä Statistical Summary

### üåΩ Overall Production Statistics

- **Total Production (2012-2023):** 30,632,354 tonnes
- **Average per County-Year:** 76,390 tonnes
- **Median per County-Year:** 42,938 tonnes
- **Standard Deviation:** 67,234 tonnes

### üìà Data Reliability Assessment

- **High Reliability Period:** 2012-2021 (94-100% coverage)
- **Medium Reliability Period:** 2022 (89% coverage)
- **Low Reliability Period:** 2023 (47% coverage)

---

## üéØ Recommendations

### üîß Immediate Actions Required

1. **Investigate Missing Data:** Contact MoALD to understand why Kakamega and other counties have no recent data
2. **Validate Extreme Changes:** Verify 2017-2018 and 2015-2016 production jumps
3. **Complete 2023 Data:** Fill gaps for missing counties

### üìä Analysis Strategy

1. **Primary Analysis Period:** Use 2012-2021 data (most reliable)
2. **Handle Missing Counties:** Develop imputation strategies for gaps
3. **Cross-Validation:** Compare with FAO, World Bank, and other agricultural datasets

### üö® Data Quality Improvements

1. **Standardize Collection:** Ensure consistent county coverage across years
2. **Quality Checks:** Implement validation for extreme year-over-year changes
3. **Timely Reporting:** Reduce delays in data publication

## üìã Conclusion

The maize yield data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development provides valuable insights into Kenya's agricultural production patterns but suffers from **significant data quality issues** in recent years.

**Key Findings:**

- ‚úÖ **2012-2021:** Reliable data with 94-100% county coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **2022:** Declining reliability with 89% coverage
- ‚ùå **2023:** Critical gaps with only 47% coverage
- üö® **Missing Data:** Major producer Kakamega has no records
- üîç **Anomalies:** Suspicious production spikes need verification

**Recommendation:** This dataset should be used with caution for recent years (2022-2023) and requires data quality improvements before being used for predictive modeling or current policy decisions.
