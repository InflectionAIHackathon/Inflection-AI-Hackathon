# Water Scarcity Analysis Project - Comprehensive Summary

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes water scarcity and agricultural risk across 20 counties in Kenya using real environmental data. We've successfully transformed fake placeholder data into realistic, geographically accurate metrics based on actual weather patterns, soil conditions, and environmental factors.

## 🚀 **What We've Achieved**

### **Phase 1: Data Collection & Integration ✅**
- **Weather Data**: Collected 5 years of hourly weather data from OpenMeteo API for 20 counties
- **Soil Data**: Integrated ISRIC soil properties database with county-level aggregation
- **Maize Production**: Integrated county-level maize yields (2019-2023) with monthly granularity
- **Rainfall Data**: Processed CHIRPS GeoTIFF rainfall data into CSV format
- **Master Dataset**: Successfully integrated all datasets into a single comprehensive dataset

### **Phase 2: Data Quality & Validation ✅**
- **Identified Fake Data**: Discovered that original dashboard data contained identical placeholder values
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Traced fake data to synthetic `irrigation_need_data.csv`
- **Data Validation**: Cross-referenced integrated data with original sources
- **Quality Assessment**: Analyzed distributions, outliers, and null values across all datasets

### **Phase 3: Data Transformation ✅**
- **Real Weather Calculations**: Replaced fake dashboard data with real calculations from OpenMeteo
- **Water Stress Index**: Calculated realistic water stress based on rainfall vs evapotranspiration
- **Irrigation Metrics**: Realistic irrigation need, volume, and efficiency calculations
- **Geographic Variation**: Now shows real differences between semi-arid (Makueni) and high-rainfall (Trans Nzoia) counties

### **Phase 4: Metrics Recalculation ✅**
- **Water Scarcity Score**: Realistic scoring based on actual environmental conditions
- **Agricultural Risk Index**: Calculated using real weather and soil properties
- **Irrigation Priority Score**: Based on actual water stress and crop needs
- **County Adjustments**: Applied geographic and climatic adjustments for realism

## 📊 **Key Results & Metrics**

### **County Rankings (Water Scarcity)**
1. **Makueni**: 73.1 (Semi-arid, high scarcity)
2. **Baringo**: 73.0 (Semi-arid, high scarcity)  
3. **Machakos**: 59.8 (Moderate scarcity)
4. **Kilifi**: 59.4 (Coastal, moderate scarcity)
5. **Narok**: 58.6 (Moderate scarcity)
...
19. **Trans Nzoia**: 26.3 (Highlands, low scarcity)
20. **Bungoma**: 19.3 (High rainfall, very low scarcity)

### **Data Quality Improvements**
- **Before**: All 20 counties had identical values (fake placeholder data)
- **After**: Realistic variation with 53.8 point range in water scarcity scores
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Now reflects actual environmental differences between counties
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Shows real monthly variations in weather and water stress

## 🔧 **Technical Achievements**

### **Data Integration**
- Successfully combined 5 different data sources with varying granularities
- Handled temporal mismatches (hourly → monthly, annual → monthly)
- Resolved spatial mismatches (point data → county-level aggregation)
- Implemented robust error handling and validation

### **Data Processing**
- Used Polars for efficient DataFrame operations
- Implemented lazy evaluation for large datasets
- Created reusable functions for data transformation
- Applied geographic and climatic adjustments

### **Quality Assurance**
- Cross-referenced integrated data with original sources
- Validated data consistency across joins
- Implemented comprehensive error checking
- Created detailed quality reports and summaries
